# FileRename
I need a program to remove a certain amount of characters from the front of a file.
Warning!! Does it to the whole folder.
Ex:
  - MP3 FOLDER
    - NEED_TO_RENAME FOLDER:
      - myNewMixtapeSong.mp3  ->  remove 2 -> NewMixtapeSong.mp3
      - myOldMixedTape.mp3    ->  remove 2 -> OldMixedTape.mp3
